# nightchill
NightChill is a journey-based wellness app helping people rebuild structure, discipline, and belonging. By connecting users with anxiety-friendly gyms, mentors, role models, and simple support gestures like coffee QR codes, NightChill turns small steps into lasting strength.

## Map Support Tags System

NightChill uses a comprehensive tagging system to help users find the right support at the right time:

- **☕ Coffee Support** - Simple support gestures (coffee QR codes, material help)
- **🤝 Mentor-Safe** - Verified mentors and guidance providers
- **🛡️ Anxiety-Friendly** - Spaces designed to accommodate anxiety

## Spartan Path vs Wellness Graph

Two complementary approaches to rebuilding strength:

- **⚔️ Spartan Path** - Discipline through challenge (warrior's journey)
- **📊 Wellness Graph** - Growth through understanding (healer's journey)

## Dirty Boxer Philosophy

The "dirty boxer" represents getting in the ring when you're not perfect, showing up with your scars, and building strength through real struggle. Whether you follow the Spartan Path or Wellness Graph, you're a dirty boxer if you keep showing up.
