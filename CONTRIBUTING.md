# Contributing to NightChill

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NightChill! This project is about creating a safe, supportive, and anxiety-friendly wellness hub. We're glad you're here.

## Our Values

Before contributing, please understand our core values:

1. **Compassion First** — Everything we build should reduce anxiety, not create it
2. **Accessibility** — Features should be inclusive and available to everyone
3. **No Pressure** — Language and features should never guilt or shame users
4. **Privacy Matters** — User data and privacy are sacred
5. **Simple & Clear** — Complexity is the enemy of accessibility

## Code of Conduct

### Be Kind
- Use supportive, inclusive language
- Respect different perspectives and experiences
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community

### Be Professional
- No aggressive or intimidating language
- No toxic hustle culture or pressure tactics
- No shaming or judgment in code comments or documentation

### Be Thoughtful
- Consider accessibility in every feature
- Think about users experiencing anxiety
- Design for calm, not chaos

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs or suggesting features:

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use clear, descriptive titles**
3. **Provide context:**
   - What were you trying to do?
   - What happened instead?
   - How can we reproduce it?
4. **Consider accessibility:** How does this affect anxious or overwhelmed users?

### Suggesting Features

Great feature suggestions include:

- **User benefit:** How does this help reduce anxiety or build structure?
- **Alignment:** Does this fit NightChill's calm, supportive mission?
- **Simplicity:** Is this the simplest solution to the problem?
- **Accessibility:** Can everyone use this, regardless of ability?

### Code Contributions

#### Before You Start

**General Principles:**
- Write clean, readable code
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Follow existing code style in the project
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new features

**Language & Tone:**
- User-facing text should be calm, supportive, and clear
- No aggressive language ("crush it", "dominate", etc.)
- No guilt-inducing language ("you should", "you must")
- Use positive reinforcement ("you showed up", "one step at a time")

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure proper contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- Include alt text for images
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers when possible
- Respect reduced motion preferences

**Privacy:**
- Never collect unnecessary data
- Always get explicit consent
- Encrypt sensitive information
- Follow GDPR principles

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clear, focused commits
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation

3. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Run existing tests
   - Test on multiple devices/browsers if applicable
   - Consider edge cases

4. **Submit a Pull Request:**

#### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add coffee QR code redemption feature
fix: resolve map marker overlap on mobile
docs: update README with installation steps
style: improve button contrast in neon mode
refactor: simplify user journey level calculation
test: add unit tests for reward system
```

Prefixes:

### Design Contributions

Designers, we need you! Here's how to contribute:

1. **Review VISION.md** for visual guidelines
2. **Respect the three modes:** Light, Dark, and Neon
3. **Design for calm:** Soft edges, gentle colors, clear hierarchy
4. **Consider accessibility:** Color blindness, low vision, motion sensitivity
5. **Share mockups:** Use Figma, Sketch, or similar tools
6. **Get feedback early:** Open a discussion before finalizing designs
