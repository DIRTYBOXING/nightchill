The Spartan Path embraces the dirty boxer mentality - getting in the ring, taking hits, and building armor through discipline. The Wellness Graph honors the analytical fighter - studying patterns, measuring growth, and building strength through understanding. Both are valid. Both lead to belonging.",
    "dirtyBoxerPhilosophy": "The 'dirty boxer' isn't about fighting dirty - it's about getting in the ring when you're not perfect, showing up with your scars, and building strength through real struggle. Whether you're a Spartan warrior or a Wellness analyst, you're a dirty boxer if you keep showing up.",
